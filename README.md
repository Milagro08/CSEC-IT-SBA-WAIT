# CSEC-IT-SBA-WAIT
This case study project was made for the CSEC IT SBA submissions, for the WAITUKUBULI AIR TRANSPORT company which needed an a software that allowed customers to book their flights to different countries.
The requirements for this program was to:
Create a program using C++ for WAIT. The travel agent must login to access the system. The
program should load the travel destinations. Once the destination has been selected the agent
should be asked to select a round trip or one way flight. The date(s) should be entered. Where
the flight is round trip the duration should be calculated.
The program should also make allowances for SkyMiles members. Store in the program a list of
FIVE (5) members and their mileage.
All discounts from the spreadsheet component apply to this program.
VAT from the spreadsheet component also applies to this program.
Allow the program to calculate VAT and Discount on the subtotal of bookings
The agents should be able to book for multiple persons in one login session. As such ensure
that the program has looping features which will allow the agent to place multiple bookings on
one bill.
OUTPUT travel details and bill at the end of the session.
